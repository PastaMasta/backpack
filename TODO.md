Things todo

- Warn about older versions of tmux / vim or autodownload / compile ?

Vim
--------

- Compile and build from a set version, so configs match up
- Column highlight only on indent-sensitive files - python, yaml
- Have a go with neovim / other vims ?
- Split config out into a more readable .vimrc
- Switch to tmux pane if file is already open

Tmux
--------

- Compile and build from a set version, so configs match up
- Shared copy/paste with alias clip behaving the same as WSL: echo something | clip
- mode-keys vi
- Start as first command, connect to existing session if there is one
