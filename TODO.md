Things todo

Setup
--------

- Warn about older versions of tmux / vim or autodownload / compile ?
- Move package installs etc into ansible

Vim
--------

- Compile and build from a set version, so configs match up
- Column highlight only on indent-sensitive files - python, yaml
- Have a go with neovim / other vims ?
- Split config out into a more readable .vimrc, plugin config in their own files
- Switch to tmux pane if file is already open
- Tab completion: always show suggestions, tab / enter swaps through them
- IDE / testing stuff ?
- Add loggers to skelingtons
- Copy highlighted text to WSL clipboard
- Switch to neovim / lunarvim?

Tmux
--------

- Compile and build from a set version, so configs match up
- Shared copy/paste with alias clip behaving the same as WSL: echo something | clip
- mode-keys vi
- Start as first command, connect to existing session if there is one

Git
-------

- Highlight changes in git add -p like in git diff
