======================

My collection of dotfiles and other bits with a setup script.

Files in ```./home/``` are symlinked into ```~/```, directories are created if missing so files outside of this repo won't be added unless desired.

Files in ```./versioned/``` are for files dependant on package versions - i.e tmux
