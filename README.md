backpack
======================

My collection of dotfiles, notes and scripts with a setup script.

Files in dotfiles are symlinked to ~/ directly

Dot directories are symlinked into ~/ if the dir doesn't already exist; if it does then
the files within that dot directory are symlinked inside the existing dir.

Also included is a gollum wiki in ./wiki, I decided against using the built in wiki so it's all contained
in one repo.
